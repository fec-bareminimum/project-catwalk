# Project Catwalk

**Setup tasks**
- run `npm install` in this directory to install the dependencies.
- run `npm run build` and `npm start` in separate terminals to start webpack and express.
- use the `config.example.js` file to create your own `config.js` and add your github API token to attach as an "Authorization" header in requests.
- run `brew install pre-commit` and run `npm postinstall` to prevent committing and pushing to the main branch.
